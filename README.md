# Adventures in Financial Data Science
Here I am collecting the scripts I have used to prepare my book "Adventures in Financial Data Science" and to support my other writing, such as that on Medium. Those for the book are mostly originally written for the RATS time-series analysis system, which is commercial software, so I have begun porting the code to Python Notebooks written for Google's colab https://colab.research.google.com. This is mostly what I will post here.

I am also including notebooks which support some of my writing on Medium, but they may be moved to an other repo at a suitable time.
